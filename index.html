		<h1>OFFSHORE SHELL COMPANY</h1>
		<p>
			This is the official home page of the world's most hollow and empty
			corporation. Founded on the principal of being as shady and hollow as
			humanly possible, we have long been one of the most reputable
			corporations to help you move millions of dollars away from paying those
			pesky taxes and instead into the purchase of your next superyacht.
		</p>
		<p>
			We just opened a new office located in Switzerland, and it is already
			home to 42,000 new shell corporations! Check out the photo of our new
			office below!
