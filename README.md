### About

This is the homepage of [offshoreshell.company](https://offshoreshell.company/),
a random secondary domain I use for miscellaneous things. This is not representative
of any real organization or business at all, it's just some silly website.

I do not accept any pull requests or commits to this repo aside from my own.

**Note:** The website runs through CloudFlare, so DDoS protection JavaScript code
not present here may be inserted by CloudFlare into your copy of the page.
